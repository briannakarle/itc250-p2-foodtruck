Project 2.  Group project.
<h1>P2: Food Truck</h1>

<p>Due Thursday by 11:59pm<br />  Points 50<br />  Submitting a website url<br /><br />
For our second group project we'll be  building a PHP application that allows a user to select items from a menu as if they are ordering from a food truck.<br />
<br />
Classes Required: Data for the food truck items must be stored in objects.
<br /><br />
The application must:
<br />
<ul>
<li>Allow items to be chosen from a form</li>
<li>Display the items chosen and add and display the total cost</li>
<li>Allow more than one of each item to be purchased</li>
<li>Each item must have at least a name, description and price</li>
<li>Disallow incorrect data and provide feedback, for example, when a user inputs a string, the data is not processed and the</li> user is informed of the mistake.
<li>Be built as nearly as possible to PSR-1 (Links to an external site.) and PSR-2 (Links to an external site.) standards</li>
<li>Be built with internal phpDocumentor documentation added</li>
</ul>
Project Document: Besides a working application, you must also show your program design pieces visually on a project document shared by your team and also with my email: williamnewman@gmail.com
<br /><br />
Visual Elements Required: Your program design document should identify an IPO chart and a flowchart of how the application will operate and process data.
<br /><br />
Source Code via Repo Required: Please show your source code iby placing your code in a repo and providing a link to your repo.  If you wish to use a private repo, you can use my GitHub username and share it with me: newmanix
<br /><br />
phpDocumentor Documentation Standards Followed: The additional element we'll add to this project is the requirement to document your code internally per phpDocumentor standards.  View the lesson named Documentation on the class website for details!
<br /><br />
Extra Credit: You can gain up to 10 points extra credit for building an application that properly includes all subtotals and sales tax to the purchase!
<br /><br />
Extra Extra Credit: You can gain up to 20 extra points for allowing sides or toppings to particular items (for example, $.25 cents for adding cheese, etc.)
